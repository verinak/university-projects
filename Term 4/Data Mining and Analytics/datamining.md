# Data Mining and Analytics

## Project Description

We had multiple project ideas to choose from. This is the one we chose.<br/>

### Prediction of Adult Income based on Census Data

The following project is the classification project to predict the income level of an individual that exceeds 50K based on the census data available at the repository. The dataset that is used in the projects are variables such as age, type of work, working hours, sex and many more. It helps in understanding the standard of living of the city, and the benefit of setting up a business or bank loan eligibility. Also, it helps in understanding the real estate preferences by average income of the people residing in the area. In this project, you will also be able to figure out the type of tourist places that people from other countries would like to travel to.<br/><br/>

### Project Requirements
- Data Preprocessing (Cleaning Data, Normalization)
- Split your data set into train data and test data (If the data is not split)
- You will use a suitable algorithm for your dataset. (Classification, Regression, Clustering, Association, etc...).
- The programming language you will be using is python and its libraries (Pandas, Numby, Matplot, Seaborn, Scikitlearn, etc...).
- After prediction, you will work on Evaluation metric.
- You will choose the suitable visualization for your project by using Matplot library from python. (Histogram, pie chart, box plot, scatterplot, etc...).
