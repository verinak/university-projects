# Introduction to Data Science

## Project Description

We have Grocery (GRC) dataset. Using this dataset, you are asked to Use (R) to do the following tasks:<br/>
- Assess and clean your data if needed
- Use a different type of Data Visualization tools for each of the following:
    - Compare cash and credit totals.
    - Compare each age and sum of total spending.
    - Show each city total spending and arrange it by total descending.
    - Display the distribution of total spending.
- Put all previous plots in one dashboard.
- Split the customers to (n) groups using one of the studied methods (n will be user input) according to the sum of total spending and their ages and print a table displaying each customer name, age, total and the computed cluster number.
- Generate association rules between items with minimum support and confidence taken from the user inputs (State the algorithm used).

<br/>
Program user inputs:

| Variable Name | Label | Notes  |  Validation |
|------|------|------|------|
| datasetPath | Dataset path | User should input the full path of the csv file | Required |
| numberOfClusters | Numbers of clusters | To use in the k-means function | Number between 2 and 4 |
| minSupport | Minimum Apriori support | To use in the Apriori algorithm | Number between 0.001 and 1 |
| minConfidence | Minimum Apriori confidence | To use in the Apriori algorithm | Number between 0.001 and 1 |
