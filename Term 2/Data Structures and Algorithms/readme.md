# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Project Description

<strong>Application of Queue in Data Structures (computer server)</strong>

Write a complete computer algorithm that simulates a computer server with the following specifications:
- The server consists of 2 computers.
- Tasks arrive at random intervals and attempt to use the available computer.
    - If the computer is available, the task is immediately allowed to use it.
    - Each task requires a certain amount of time (random number) and must wait for a certain random time.
    - If the computer is currently being used, then an arriving task waits in a Queue until a computer becomes available.
    - Assume that the task arrival time and service time follows exponential distribution. The average service time is 25 sec and the average interarrival time is 20 sec. 

Part I: You must submit an algorithm showing the detailed design that matches the above specifications.<br/>
Part II: You must submit a complete implementation of your design using C, C++, Python, Java, â€¦. Your implementation must be carefully tested against the above specifications.<br/>
Part III: Find the average waiting time after running your code for 10,000 sec.<br/>
